# **SUB-ZERO Attack Suite**  


![SUB-ZERO Banner](thumbnails/sub.png)  
## **Overview**  
SUB-ZERO is a multi-variant attack suite designed for network security testing and ethical hacking. It includes several attack vectors such as UDP flood, ICMP flood, HTTP POST flood, DNS reflection, and more. This tool is for educational and research purposes only.

## **Features**  
- **Multi-variant attack suite**: Includes multiple attack methods, modularized for easy expansion.  
- **Automated execution**: Runs indefinitely until manually stopped.  
- **Logging support**: Keeps track of attack attempts and network interactions.  
- **Modular design**: Easily extend the attack suite by adding new modules.  
- **Lightweight and fast**: Optimized to send packets efficiently with minimal delay.  

## **Installation**

## **Configuration**

Modify ice.py to customize attack parameters:

Target IP: Change the target's IP address.

Attack Type: Specify which attack module to execute.

Logging: Enable or disable attack logging in logs.txt.


Example:

target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
attack_type = "udp_flood"
enable_logging = True

## **Log File Structure**

By default, logs are stored in logs.txt in the following format:

[2025-02-23 14:30:15] UDP Flood initiated against 192.168.1.100
[2025-02-23 14:30:20] ICMP Flood attack ongoing...
[2025-02-23 14:30:30] HTTP POST Flood request sent...
